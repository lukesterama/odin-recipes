<h2>Description:</h2>
	<p> I would like to introduce you to one of my favorite breakfast dishes, Shakshouka! I say <em>breakfast</em> but truthfully Shakshouka can be eaten anytime of the day.</p>
	<p>Shakshouka or <em>shakshuka</em> is a delicious combination of eggs poached in a sauce of tomatoes, olive oil, peppers, onions and garlic, and commonly spiced with cumin, paprika and cayenne pepper.
	<p>The word <strong>Shakshouka</strong> loosely translates to <em>all mixed up</em> in Arabic, which is an apt description and hints at the potent spice and exotic flavors of this remarkably simple yet delicious dish.</p>
