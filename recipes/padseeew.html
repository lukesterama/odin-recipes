<h2>Description:</h2>
	<p>One of my favorite dishes for dinner is the Thai comfort food <strong>Pad See Ew.</strong></p>
	<p> Pad See Ew is a Thai street food made with wide rice noodles coated in a rich, savory, slightly sweet brown sauce. </p>
	<p>This variation on the dish will be vegetarian and made with tofu, but you can use for your favorite protein.</p>
<h2>Ingredients:</h2>

	<ul>
	<li>1 lbs flat rice noodles <em>store bought</em></li>
	<li>4 oz firm tofu</li>
	<li>1 tablespoon neutral oil, <em>such as canola</em></li>
	<li>3 garlic cloves, minced</li>
	<li>1 cup roughly chopped gai lan (Chinese broccoli)</li>
	<li>2½ tablespoons soy sauce, plus more to taste</li>
	<li>1 tablespoon fish sauce, plus more to taste</li>
	<li>2 teaspoons granulated sugar</li>
	<li>½ teaspoon dark soy sauce</li>
	<li>Red pepper flakes, for serving</li>

	</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
	<li>First, prepare the sauce by combining the soy sauce, vegan fish sauce, sugar, and dark soy sauce in a bowl. Whisk until the sugar has dissolved.</li>
	<li>Boil and drain your noodles, then using your fingers, separate the noodles—<strong>this is crucial</strong> to ensure all the strands get coated with sauce.</li>
	<strong>Pro-tip:</strong> If your rice noodles are stiff, place them in a microwaveable bowl, cover with a damp paper towel, and microwave for about 1 minute to soften.
	<li>Heat a large wok or nonstick skillet over medium heat and add 1 tablespoon of oil. Add the garlic and sauté, about 1 minute.</li>
	<li>Add the gai lan, tofu, and 1 tablespoon of the prepared sauce, use a pair of tongs and toss to combine.</li>
	<li>Add the noodles and remaining sauce, toss the noodles until all of them are coated (Use a spatula or chopsticks to help if needed).</li>
	<li>Spread out the noodles and let cook, untouched, to char the noodles a little, 1 to 2 minutes this adds flavor and aroma to the noodles.</li>
	<li>Take skillet or wok off the heat, serve and enjoy!</li>
</ol>
