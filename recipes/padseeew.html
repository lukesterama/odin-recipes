	<h2>Description:</h2>
		<p>One of my favorite dishes for dinner is the Thai comfort food <strong>Pad See Ew.</strong></p>
		<p> Pad See Ew is a Thai street food made with wide rice noodles coated in a rich, savory, slightly sweet brown sauce. </p>
		<p>This variation on the dish will be vegetarian and made with tofu, but you can use for your favorite protein.</p>
